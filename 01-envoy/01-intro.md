# Introduction to Envoy

## Overview

As the industry transitions to microservice architectures and cloud-native solutions, managing networking complexities across services becomes increasingly difficult. **Envoy** addresses these challenges by abstracting networking concerns from application code, providing a uniform and consistent proxy solution for service-to-service communication.

## The Need for Envoy

Modern applications consist of numerous microservices communicating over networks. Debugging network issues in such an environment can be challenging due to inconsistent logging, retry mechanisms, and tracing. **Envoy** helps by handling these networking concerns externally, allowing developers to focus on business logic.

### Key Problems Solved by Envoy
- **Network Debugging Complexity**: Failure tracing across multiple services is difficult.
- **Inconsistent Logging and Tracing**: Services use varying mechanisms for logging and tracing.
- **Lack of Centralized Network Management**: Each service handles its own retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking.

By introducing Envoy, network functions are offloaded to a dedicated proxy, simplifying troubleshooting and improving reliability.

## Deployment Models

### **Sidecar Deployment**
In this model, each service runs alongside an **Envoy instance** (sidecar proxy). The Envoy and application form an atomic entity, yet remain separate processes. The application handles business logic while Envoy manages networking concerns.

### **Edge Proxy Deployment**
Envoy functions as a **front-facing proxy** (API gateway) managing external traffic before it reaches backend services. It provides TLS termination, load balancing, and authentication.

## Core Features of Envoy

### **Out-of-Process Architecture**
- Runs independently alongside applications, supporting any programming language.
- Applications send requests to a **virtual address (localhost)** instead of real hostnames.
- Enables **consistent network management** across the stack.
- Allows for **transparent deployment and upgrades** without modifying application logic.

### **L3/L4 Filter Architecture**
- Envoy operates at **Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)**.
- Uses **pluggable filters** to process network traffic.
- Supports **custom filters** for additional networking logic.

### **L7 Filter Architecture**
- Operates at **Layer 7 (HTTP)** with **HTTP filters** for advanced processing.
- Provides rate-limiting, request buffering, and content-based routing.

### **First-Class HTTP/2 Support**
- Bridges **HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2** seamlessly.
- Service-to-service communication leverages **HTTP/2 multiplexing**.

### **HTTP Routing Capabilities**
- Routes requests based on **path, authority, and runtime values**.
- Supports **REST and gRPC**.
- Useful for API gateways and service meshes.

### **gRPC Compatibility**
- Fully supports **gRPC over HTTP/2**.
- Enables **bidirectional streaming, authentication, and flow control**.

### **Service Discovery & Dynamic Configuration**
- Uses **static configuration files** or **dynamic xDS APIs**.
- Automatically reloads configurations **without downtime**.

### **Health Checking**
- **Active Health Checking**: Proactively verifies service availability.
- **Passive Health Checking**: Detects failures based on service responses.

### **Advanced Load Balancing**
- **Automatic retries**
- **Circuit breaking**
- **Global rate limiting**
- **Outlier detection and traffic mirroring**

### **Edge Proxy Capabilities**
- **TLS termination**
- **Support for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3**
- **Advanced routing capabilities**

### **Security: TLS Termination & Mutual TLS (mTLS)**
- Envoy enables **mTLS between services**, securing intra-service communication.
- Can be used for **zero-trust networking**.

### **Observability: Logs, Metrics, and Traces**
- Provides **detailed logs and metrics** for debugging.
- Supports **StatsD and custom plugins** for observability.
- Integrates with **distributed tracing** frameworks.

### **Support for HTTP/3 (Alpha Feature)**
- Envoy 1.19.0 introduces **experimental support for HTTP/3**.
- **Translates HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 requests** seamlessly.

## Conclusion
Envoy simplifies microservice communication by abstracting networking complexities. By serving as a **sidecar proxy** or **edge proxy**, it enhances observability, security, and load balancing while enabling efficient debugging. With support for **HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, gRPC, and emerging HTTP/3**, Envoy continues to be a leading proxy solution for modern cloud-native architectures.

### **Why Use Envoy?**
| Feature                         | Benefit |
|---------------------------------|---------|
| **Service Mesh Integration**    | Enables sidecar-based communication for microservices. |
